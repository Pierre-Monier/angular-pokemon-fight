*The goal of this project was to learn how to use the Angular framework*

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.2.2.

We create an app to create Pokemons with their moves and make them fight. 

## Project structure

We create the project with the "folder by feature" design. We have a shared folder where we add the common logic. Furthermore, we use Firebase for our backend needs.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
